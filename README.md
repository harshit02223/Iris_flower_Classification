# Iris_flower_Classification
Iris Flower Classification uses ML to predict flower species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) based on sepal/petal features. Models like Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, and more are trained, evaluated, and saved. Ideal for ML beginners and portfolio projects.

PROJECT OVERVIEW:
This project demonstrates the classification of iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and
Virginica,
using popular machine learning algorithms. It involves data exploration, visualization, model training,
evaluation,
and deployment. The goal is to build a robust classifier that can predict the species of an iris flower
based on its measurements.

DATASET iNFORMATION:
- Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository - Iris Dataset
- Format: CSV
